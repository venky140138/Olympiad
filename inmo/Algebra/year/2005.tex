\item Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be positive integers such that
\begin{align*}
\frac{43}{197} < \frac{\alpha}{\beta} < \frac{17}{77}
\end{align*}
Find the minimum possible value of $\beta$?

\item Let p,q,r be positive real numbers, not all equal, such that some two of the equations 
\begin{align}
px^{2} + 2qx + r = 0 
\end{align}
\begin{align} 
qx^{2} + 2rx + p = 0 
\end{align}  
\begin{align} 
rx^{2} + 2px + q = 0 
\end{align} 
have a common root say $\alpha$. Prove that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\alpha$ is a real and negative
\item the third equation has non-real roots.
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $x_1$ be a given positive integer. A sequence 
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} = \{x_1, x_2, x_3,......\}
\end{align*}
of positive integers is such that $x_n$ for $n \geq 2$ is obtained from $x_{n-1}$ by adding some non-zero digit of $x_{n-1}$. Prove that
\begin{enumerate}
\item the sequence has an even number
\item the sequence has infinitely many even numbers.
\end{enumerate}
