\item Let n be a natural number such that n = $a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}$, for some natural numbers a,b,c. Prove that
\begin{align*}
9n = (p_{1}a + q_{1}b + r_{1}c)^{2} + (p_{2}a + q_{2}b + r_{2}c)^{2} + (p_{3}a + q_{3}b + r_{3}c)^{2}
\end{align*}
where $p_{j}^{'}s, q_{j}^{'}s, r_{j}^{'}s$ are all nonzero integers. Further, if 3 does not divide at least one of a,b,c, prove that 9n can be expresses $x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}$, where z,y,z are natural numbers none of which is divisible by 3.

\item Let m and n be a positive integers such that the equation $x^{2} - mx + n = 0$ has real roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Prove that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are integers if and only if [m$\alpha$] + [m$\beta$] is the square of an integer.

\item Let x,y,z are positive real numbers, Prove that
\begin{align*}
(x + y + z)^{2}(yz + zx + xy)^{2} \leq 3(y^{2} + yz + z^{2})(z^{2} + zx + x^{2})(x^{2} + xy + y^{2}).
\end{align*}
