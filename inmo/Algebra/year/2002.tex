\item Determine the least positive value taken by the expression
\begin{align*} 
a^{3} + b^{3} + c^{3} - 3abc
\end{align*}
 as a,b,c vary over all positive integers. Find also all triples(a,b,c) for which this least value is attained.

\item Let x,y be positive reals such that x + y= 2. Prove that
\begin{align*}
 x^{3}y^{3}(x^{3} + y^{3}) \leq 2.
\end{align*}

\item Does there exist three distince positive real numbers a,b,c such that the numbers a, b, c, b + c - a, 
c + a - b, a + b - c and a + b + c from a 7-term arthemetic progression in some order?
