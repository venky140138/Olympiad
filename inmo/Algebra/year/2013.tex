\item Let a,b,c,x,y,z be positive real numbers such that a + b + c = x + y + z and abc = xyz. Further, suppose that $a \leq x < y < z \leq c$ and $a < b < c$. Prove that a=x, b=y and c=z.

\item Let a,b,c,d be positive integers such that $a \geq b \geq c \geq d$. Prove that the equation 
\begin{align*}
x^{4} - ax^{3} - bx^{2} - cx - d = 0
\end{align*}
has no integer solution.

\item Find all positive integers m, n and primes $p \geq 5$ such that
\begin{align*}
m(4m^{2} + m + 12) = 3(p^{n} - 1).
\end{align*}
