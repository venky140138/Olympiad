\item For positive real numbers a, b, c, which of the following statements
necessarily implies a = b = c: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $a(b^3 + c^3 ) = b(c^3 + a^3 ) = c(a^3 + b^3 )$,
\item $a(a^3 + b^3 ) = b(b^3 + c^3 ) = c(c^3 + a^3 )$? Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider a nonconstant arithmetic progression $a_1, a_2,........, a_n$, Suppose there
exist relatively prime positive integers $p > 1$ and $q > 1$ such that $a_1^{2},a_{p+1}^{2}$ and
$a_{q+1}^{2}$ are also the terms of the same arithmetic progression. Prove that the terms of the arithmetic progression are all integers.
