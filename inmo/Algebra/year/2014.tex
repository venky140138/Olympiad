\item Let n be a natural number. Prove that
\begin{align*}
[\frac{1}{n}] + [\frac{n}{2}] + [\frac{n}{3}] + .......[\frac{n}{n}] + [\sqrt{n}]
\end{align*}
is even.

\item Let a,b be natural numbers with $ab > 2$. Suppose that the sum of their greatest common divisor and least common multiple is divisible by a+b. Prove that the quotient is at most (a+b)/4. When is this quotient exactly equal to (a+b)/4?

\item Written on a blackboard is the polynomial $x^{2} + x + 2014$. Calvin and Hobbes take turns alternatively in the following game. During his turn, Calvin should either increase or decrease the coefficient of x by 1. And during his turn, Hobbes should either increase or decrease the constant coefficient by 1. Calvin wins if at any point of time the polynomial on the blackboard at that instant has integer roots. Prove that Calvin has a winning strategy.
