\item Suppose p is a prime greater than 3. Find all pairs of integers (a,b) satisfying the equation
\begin{align*} 
a^{2} + 3ab + 2p(a + b) + p^{2} = 0
\end{align*}

\item If $\alpha$ is real root of the equation $x^{5} - x^{3} + x - 2 = 0$, prove that [$\alpha^{6}$] = 3.

\item Prove that the number of 5-tuples of positive integers (a,b,c,d,e) satisfying the equation
\begin{align*} 
abcde = 5(bcde + acde + abde + abce + abcd)
\end{align*}
