\item Call a natural number n faithful, if there exists natural numbers $a<b<c$ such that a divides b, b divides c and n = a + b + c.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that all but a finite number of natural numbers are faithful.
\item Find the sum of all natural numbers which are not faithful. 
\end{enumerate} 

\item Consider two polynomials 
\begin{align*}
P(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + .....a_{1}x + a_{0} and\\
Q(x) = b_{n}x^{n} + b_{n-1}x^{n-1} + .....b_{1}x + b_{0}
\end{align*}
with integer coefficients such that $a_n - b_n$ is a prime, $a_{n-1} = b_{n-1}$ and $a_{n}b_{0} - a_{0}b_{n} \neq 0$. Suppose there exists a rational number r such that P(r) = Q(r) = 0. Prove that r is an integer.
