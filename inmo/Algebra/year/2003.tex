\item Find all primes p and q and even numbers $n > 2$ satisfying the equation
\begin{align*} 
p^{n} + p^{n-1} +.....+ p+1 = q^{2} + q + 1.
\end{align*}

\item Show that for every real number a the equation
\begin{align*}
8x^{4} - 16x^{3} + 16x^{2} - 8x + a = 0
\end{align*}
has at least real non-real root and find the sum of all the non-real roots of the equation.
