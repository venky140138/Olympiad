\item In an acute-angled triangle ABC, a point D lies on the segment BC. Let $O_1, O_2$ denote the circumcentres of triangles ABD and ACD, respectively. Prove that the line joining the circumcentre of triangle ABC and the orthocentre of triangle $O_{1}O_{2}D$ is parallel to BC.

\item In a triangle ABC, let D be a point on the segment BC such that AB + BD = AC + CD. Suppose that the
points B, C and the centroids of triangles ABD and ACD lie on a circle. Prove that AB = AC.
