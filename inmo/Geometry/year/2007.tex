\item In a triangle ABC right-angles at C, the median through B bisects the angle between BA and the bisector of $\angle$B. Prove that
\begin{align*}
\frac{5}{2} < \frac{AB}{BC} < 3.
\end{align*}

\item Let ABC be a triangle in which AB = AC. Let D be the mid-point of BC and P be a point on AD. Suppose E is the foot of perpendicular from P on AC. If $\frac{AP}{PD} = \frac{BP}{PE} = \lambda$, $\frac{BD}{AD} = m$ and z = $m^{2}(1 + \lambda)$, Prove that
\begin{align*}
z^{2} - (\lambda^{3} - \lambda^{2} - 2)z + 1 = 0.
\end{align*}
Hence show that $\lambda \geq 2$ and $\lambda$ = 2 if and only if ABC is equilateral.
