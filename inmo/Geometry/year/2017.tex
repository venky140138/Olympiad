\item ABCD is a square sheet of paper. It is folded along EF such that A goes to a point $A^{'}$ different from B and C, on the side BC and D goes to $D^{'}$. The line $A^{'} D^{'}$ cuts CD in G. Show that the inradius of the triangle GC$A^{'}$ is the sum of the inradii of the triangles G$D^{'}$F and $A^{'}$BE.

\item Let ABCDE be a convex pentagon in which $\angle$A = $\angle$B = $\angle$C = $\angle$D = $120^{o}$
and side lengths are five consecutive integers in some order. Find all possible values of AB + BC + CD.

\item Let ABC be a triangle with $\angle$A = $90^{o}$ and $AB < AC$. Let AD be the altitude from A on to BC. Let P, Q and I denote respectively the incentres of triangles ABD, ACD and ABC. Prove that AI is perpendicular to PQ and AI = PQ.
