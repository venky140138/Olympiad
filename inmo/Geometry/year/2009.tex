\item Let ABC be a triangle and let P be an interior point such that $angle$BPC = $90^{O}$, $angle$BAP =  $angle$BCP. Let M, N be the mid points of AC, BC respectively. Suppose BP = 2PM. Prove that A,P,N are collinear.

\item Let ABC be an acute-angles triangle and let H be its ortho-centre. Let $h_{max}$ denote the largest altitude of the triangle ABC. Prove that
\begin{align*}
AH + BH + CH \leq 2h_{max}
\end{align*}
