\item The in-circle of triangle ABC touches the sides BC, CA and AB in K, L and M respectively. The line through A and parallel to LK meets MK in P and the line through A and parallel to MK meets LK in Q. Show that the line PQ bisects the sides AB and AC of triangle ABC.

\item In a convex quadrilateral PQRS, PQ = RS,
 $(\sqrt{3} + 1)$QR = SP and $\angle$RSP - $\angle$SPQ = $30^{o}$. Prove that
\begin{align*} 
\angle PQR - \angle QRS = 90^{o}.
\end{align*}
