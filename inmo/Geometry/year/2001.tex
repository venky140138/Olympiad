\item Let ABC be a triangle in which no angle is $90^{o}$. For any point P in the plane of the triangle, let $A_1, B_1, C_1$ denote the reflections of P in the sides BC, CA, AB respectively. Prove the following statements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If P is the incentre or an excentre of ABC, then P is the circumcentre of $A_1B_1C_1$
\item If P is the circumcentre of ABC, then P is the orthocentre of $A_1B_1C_1$
\item If P is the orthocentre of ABC, then P is either the incentre or an excentre of
$A_1B_1C_1$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Let ABC be a triangle and D be the mid-point of side BC. Suppose $\angle$ DAB = $\angle$ BCA and $\angle$ DAC = $15^{o}$. Show that $\angle$ ADC is obtuse. Further, if O is the circumcentre of ADC, Prove that triangle AOD is equilateral.
