\item Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two circles touching each other externally at R. Let $l_1$ be a line which is tangent to $T_2$ at P and passing through the centre $O_1$ of $T_1$. Similarly, let $l_2$ be a line which is tangent to $T_2$ at Q and passing through the centre $O_2$ of $T_2$. Suppose $l_1$ and $l_2$ are not parallel and intersect at K. If KP = KQ, Prove that the triangle PQR is equilateral.

\item In an acute triangle ABC, O is the circumcentre, H is the orthocentre and G is the centroid. Let OD be perpendicular to BC and HE be perpendicular to CA, with D on BC and E on CA. Let F be the midpoint of AB. Suppose the areas of triangles ODC, HEA and GFB are equal. Find all the possible values of C.
