\item Let R denote the set of all real numbers. Find all functions f : R $\to$ R satisfying the condition
\begin{align*}
f(x + y) = f(x)f(y)f(xy)
\end{align*}
for all x, y in R.

\item Given any nine integers show that it is possible to choose, from among them, four
integers a, b, c, d such that a + b - c - d is divisible by 20. Further show that such a
selection is not possible if we start with eight integers instead of nine.
