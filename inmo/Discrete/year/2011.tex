\item Find all functions f: R $\to$ R such that
\begin{align*}
f(x + y)f(x - y) = (f(x) + f(y))^{2} - 4x^{2}f(y),
\end{align*}
for all x,y $\in$ R, R denotes the set of all real numbers.

\item Suppose five of the nine vertices of a regular nine-sided polygon are arbitarly chosen. Show that one can select four among these five such that they are the vertices of a trapezium.
