\item Find all real functions f from R $\to$ R satisfying the relation
\begin{align*}
f (x^{2} + yf (x)) = xf (x + y).
\end{align*}

\item There are four basket ball players A, B, C, D. Initially, the ball is with A. The ball is always passed from one person to a different person. In how many ways can the ball come back to A after seven
passes? (For example A $\to$ C $\to$ B $\to$ D $\to$ A $\to$ B $\to$ C $\to$ A and A $\to$ D $\to$ A $\to$ D $\to$ C $\to$ A $\to$ B $\to$ A are two ways in which the ball can come back to A after seven passes.)
