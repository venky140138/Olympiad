\item Suppose the $n^{2}$ numbers 1,2,3,.....$n^{2}$ are arranged to form an n by n array consisting of n rows and n columns such that the numbers in each row and each column are in increasing order. Denote by $a_{jk}$ the number in j-th row and k-th column. Suppose $b_{j}$ is the maximum possible number of entries that can occur as $a_{ij}$, $1 \leq j \leq n$. Prove that
\begin{align*}
b_1 + b_2 + b_3 +.......b_n \leq \frac{n}{3}(n^{2} - 3n + 5).
\end{align*}

\item Do there exist 100 lines in the plane, no three of them concurrent, such that they intersect exactly in 2002 points?
