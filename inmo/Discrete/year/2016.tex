\item Let N denote the set of all natural numbers. Define a function T : N $\to$ N by
T(2k) = k and T(2k + 1) = 2k + 2. We write $T^{2}(n)$ = T(T(n)) and in general
$T^{k}(n) = T^{k-1}(T(n))$ for any $k > 1$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that for each n $\in$ N, there exists k such that $T^{k}$(n) = 1.
\item For k $\in$ N, let $c_k$ denote the number of elements in the set $\{n : T^{k}(n) = 1\}$.
Prove that $c_{k+2} = c_{k+1} + c_{k}$s, for $k \geq 1$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Suppose 2016 points of the circumference of a circle are coloured red and the remaining points are coloured blue. Given any natural number n $\geq$ 3, Prove that there is a regular n-sided polygon all of whose vertices are blue.
