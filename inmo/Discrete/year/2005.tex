\item Find all solutions f : R $\to$ R such that 
\begin{align*}
f(x^{2} + yf(z)) = xf(x) + zf(y)
\end{align*}
for all x,y,z in R. 

\item All possible 6-digit numbers, in each of which the digits occur in non-increasing order(from left to right e.g., 877550) are written as a sequence in increasing order. Find the $2005^{th}$ number in this sequence.
