\item Let X denote the set of all triples (a, b, c) of integers. Define a function f: X $\to$ X by
\begin{align*}
f(a, b, c) = (a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, abc).
\end{align*}
Find all triples (a, b, c) in X such that f(f(a, b, c)) = (a, b, c).

\item Some 46 squares are randomly chosen from 9 $\times$ 9 chess board and are coloured red. Show that there exists a 2 $\times$ 2 block of squares of which at least three are coloured red.
