\item Let $\sigma = (a_1, a_2, a_3,.....,a_n)$ be a permutation of (1, 2, 3,....,n). A pair $(a_i, a_j)$ is said to correspond to an inversion of $\sigma$, $i < j$ but $a_i > a_j$. (Example: In the permutation (2,4,5,3,1) there are 6 inversions corresponding to the pairs (2,1), (4,3),(4,1),(5,3),(5,1),(3,1).) How many permutations of (1,2,3,...,n), ($n \geq 3$), have exactly two inversions?
