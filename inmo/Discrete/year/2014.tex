\item Let a,b be natural numbers with $ab > 2$. Suppose that the sum of their greatest common divisor and least common multiple is divisible by a+b. Prove that the quotient is at most (a+b)/4. When is this quotient exactly equal to (a+b)/4?

\item Let n be a natural number and X = {1, 2,......., n}. For subsets A and B of X we define A$\triangle$B to be the set of all those elements of X which belong to exactly one of A and B. Let F be a collection of subsets of X such that for any two distinct elements A and B in F the set A$\triangle$B has at least two elements. Show that F has at most $2^{n-1}$ elements. Find all such collections F with $2^{n-1}$ elements.
